things I've made in python i guess

**anagram.py**
- at the bottom of the script, run the `anagram("", "")` function, where between the `""` you put the strings you want to check, they will return through the console. if you just want a `true` or `false` responce, just run `checkAnagram("", "")`, nothing will appear in the console. - Created for TN's programer test
